    "# An Overview of the A* Algorithm\n",
    "A* is a shortest path algorithm for a weighted graph using a heuristic search function, first published in 1968. Another rather famous shortest path algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, is a special case of A* that uses a uniform search strategy. In search theory, A* is what is known as a \"best-first search\" -- essentially it uses some inherent information embedded in the graph to guide the search from a start node to an end node."
